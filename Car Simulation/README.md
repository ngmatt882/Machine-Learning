# Self Driving Car

Cars with sensors learn to drive using a Neural Network. 
The cars' "brain" is first randomized and later selected for later generations based on distance traveled forward.
Selection is done through the save icon to the left of the road and refresh page to see the next generation move.

Feel free to play around with the population size and the mutation rate to see how quickly the population will eventually learn!
